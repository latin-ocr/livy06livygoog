summoned together into the capitol all those matrons who
had honses in the city of Rome, or within ten miles os it3
abd from this number they chose twenty-five, to whom they
paid in a contritiution out of their own effecte. „with this
money a gotden basin was made, and= carried to the Aven-
tine‚ where the matronS, with every demonstration of purity
