Wherefore, since the immortal gods have deterrui-ned other-
wise, and though Ι ought ‘not to -decline death3 yet while Ι
am free, while 1 am master of· mysels, Ι can, by a death
both honourable and easy, avoid the tot-tures and indignities‘
which the enemy hopes to inflict on me. Never will l see
Appius Claudius and Quintus Fulvius dpuffed up with the
insolence of victory5 nor will Ibe dragge in chains through
the city of Rome as a ectacle in their triumph, that 1 may
asterium-d, either in a ungeon or tied to a stake, have my
back mangled with stripeS, and submit my neck to a Roman
axe ς never will I see my native city demolished and reduced

- to asheS, nor the Campanian matrons and virg-ins dragged

to violation. Alba, from 'whence they themselves sprung,
they razed from the foundation, that no monument of their
extraction or origin might exist. Cau 1 believe that they

When you· s alfhave indulged plentisully m food and wine,

cup will save our bodies from tot-ture, our munds from insult,
our eyes and ears fromthe sight and hearing os all the
crueltioe and indignities that await the-conquered. There
w'ill be persons in readiness to throw our lifeiess bodies ou
a large pile kindled ia· the courtyard os 'the house. This
way alone conducts us to death with honour and freedom.
Our enemies themselves will admire our con-rage, and Hans-
nibal will be convinced that the allies‚·whom he deserted
and betrayed, were men os determined vamur?
