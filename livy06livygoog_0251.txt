money due. Tlie consul Claudiae, on returning to his
camp, ordered the head of Hasdrubal, which he‘ had care-
i'ullybrought with him, to be thrown before the' advanced,
guar-‚ds of· the enemy3 a'nd the African prisonem, chained
ns theyfflwere, to be exposed to their view. Two of these
vhe also unbound and sent to Hannibal, with orders to in·
form him of what had ha ed. We are told thatHan· Ι
nibal, ‘deeply struck δῖ a master so fatal to his country,
and lus· house, said t at he felt now the fortune os Oar-

to draw together into Bruttium, the remotest corner os Italy,
all those consedentes whom, while scattered nt wide dis-
tance-³, he coults not protect3 and he removed from their
own habitations, and carried away into Bruttium, all the
Metapontines, and such of the Lucanians as acknowlecged

his authority.
