difficulty in posscssing himself of Thronium, as Attalus
had met at Opus. This city was inhabited by foreignerS,
natives of Thebes in Phthiotis, wh0, when their own was

AEtolianS, and had obtained from thern a settlement in this
place, which had been laid waste and deserted in the former
war with the same Philip. After recovering Thronium in
the manner related, he continued his route3 and, having
taken Tritonos and Drymae, inconsiderable towns of Doris»,
