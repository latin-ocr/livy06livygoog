eonati-ymen Mutines,an enterprising man, and instrueted
under no less a master than Hannibal himself in all the arte

mies in such e manner, and was so notive in visitin their

filled all Sicily with his farne, and was considered ss one ot'
the principal supporto ol the Carthaginien party. The Car-
