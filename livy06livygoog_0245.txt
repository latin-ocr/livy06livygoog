Claudius had augmented his army with a number of volun-
teers·; for many, both veteran soldiers discharged from ser-
vice, and young men, offered themselves on his march·
and, as they eagerly pressed to be employed, he enlisted
such of them as, from their personal appearance, seemed fit
sor the service. The camp of Livius was near Sena and
Hasdrubal lay about five hundred paces beyond it. W ere-
fore Nem, to avoid entering it before night, halted when he
came mgb, and where he was concealed behind mountainS.
As darkness came on, his men, marching silently, were
conducted into t'entS, each by a person of his own rank3
where they were hospitably entertained,amid mutual con-
gratulations and unbounded joy. Next da a council was

Licinus. At this time his camp was joined to that of the
consuls. It should however be noticed, that before their
coming he had often baffled and perplexed the enemy, lead-

narrow defi es to arrest his march, sometimes harassing
him b attacks on his rear or flanks, and putting in practice,

their long march, and want of sleep3 and alm, that he should
take a few days to himself to gain some knowledge of the

it was without its commander, nor moved a step in pursuit
